- For the portfolio, have a visual representation of the SFML project. A project name should be under this visual.
- A toggle system through the different projects.
- If you hit enter, then it will launch the project.
- No using .exe files to launch the projects. Instead, we need to create a parent class named Launchable, Runnable,
whatever you want, and each of your programs should derive from this class.

- Change sf::RenderWindow, to sf::RenderTexture and draw the Launchable to the sf::RenderTexture. A sf::Sprite will
disply the sf::RenderTexture when we draw the sf::Sprite to the sf::RenderWindow.
